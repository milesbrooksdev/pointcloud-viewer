# Point Cloud Viewer — Projects Page

## What Was Built

A new **Projects** page (`projects.html`) that displays a portfolio of 3D scanning and mechanical engineering work. Each project card features a live, auto-rotating point cloud preview using Three.js.

## Files Added

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `projects.html` | Main projects page with 4 project cards and mini viewers |
| `previews/project1.pcd` | Synthetic point cloud — "scanned sphere" style |
| `previews/project2.pcd` | Synthetic point cloud — terrain/elevation data |
| `previews/project3.pcd` | Synthetic point cloud — mechanical gear shape |
| `previews/project4.pcd` | Synthetic point cloud — organic particle aggregation |
| `generate_previews.py` | Python script to generate synthetic PCD files |
| `README.md` | This file — documentation and how-to |

## How the Mini Viewers Work

Each project card includes a compact Three.js point cloud viewer:

- **Size:** 280×200px container
- **Auto-rotation:** Gentle turntable animation (no user interaction needed)
- **Format:** PCD (Point Cloud Data) loaded via Three.js `PCDLoader`
- **Styling:** Dark background (`#050805`) matching the site's cyberpunk green aesthetic
- **Performance:** ~7k-10k points per preview, 60fps rotation

## Architecture

```
Project Card
├── Preview Container (Three.js canvas)
│   ├── PCDLoader loads .pcd file
│   ├── Auto-rotate animation loop
│   └── Points rendered as small sprites
└── Info Pane
    ├── Category tag
    ├── Project title
    ├── Description
    ├── Metadata (points, accuracy, year)
    └── Action buttons
```

## Swapping in Real Scans

The synthetic point clouds are placeholders. To use real project data:

1. Export your scan as **PCD format** (ASCII or binary)
2. Replace the file in `previews/project{N}.pcd`
3. Update the metadata in `projects.html` (point count, accuracy, etc.)
4. Optionally add RGB color data to the PCD for colored point clouds

The viewer supports both monochrome and RGB point clouds automatically.

## Home Page Integration

The "View Projects" button on `index.html` now links to `projects.html`.

## Design Notes

- Matches existing dark green color scheme (`--c-bg-base: #0a0f0a`, `--c-accent: #00ff6a`)
- Uses same fonts: Playfair Display (serif), Space Mono (monospace)
- Responsive layout: stacks vertically on mobile
- Noise overlay and subtle borders maintain visual consistency with main page

## Technical Stack

- **Three.js** 0.160.0 (via CDN)
- **PCDLoader** from Three.js examples
- **Vanilla JS** modules (no build step)
- **Static hosting** friendly (GitHub Pages compatible)

## C4 Color Palette (from `colorPalleteC4.html`)

The active site palette is now based on the new light/teal C4 direction:

- `--c-bg-base`: `#f0f7f9`
- `--c-bg-overlay`: `rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.05)`
- `--c-text-main`: `#0a192f`
- `--c-text-muted`: `#4a6fa5`
- `--c-accent`: `#008080`
- `--c-secondary-accent`: `#00a8a8`
- `--c-golden`: `#00ced1`

### Palette Notes
- The palette shifts the brand from neon-cyberpunk green to a cleaner technical/aqua tone.
- Contrast stays strong for headings and nav while feeling lighter and more modern.
- Accent glow and borders are now teal/cyan-based to keep interaction cues clear.
